## Introduction

Are you looking to seamlessly convert LaTeX documents to XPS format in your Java applications? Aspose.TeX for Java provides a powerful solution, allowing you to achieve this with ease. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of converting LaTeX to XPS using Aspose.TeX.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.TeX for Java library downloaded. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/java/).

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages for your Java project. Ensure that you include the Aspose.TeX library in your project dependencies.

```java
package com.aspose.tex.LaTeXXpsConversionSimplest;

import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

import com.aspose.tex.InputFileSystemDirectory;
import com.aspose.tex.Interaction;
import com.aspose.tex.OutputFileSystemDirectory;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXConfig;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXJob;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXOptions;
import com.aspose.tex.rendering.XpsDevice;
import com.aspose.tex.rendering.XpsSaveOptions;

import util.Utils;
```

Now let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps using the provided code examples.

## Step 1: Set Input and Output Directories

```java
options.setInputWorkingDirectory(new InputFileSystemDirectory("Your Input Directory"));
options.setOutputWorkingDirectory(new OutputFileSystemDirectory("Your Output Directory"));
```

Specify the directories where your LaTeX input file is located and where you want to save the converted XPS file.

## Step 2: Configure TeX Options

Configure various options to customize the conversion process according to your needs.

```java
options.setInteraction(Interaction.NonstopMode);
options.setDateTime(new GregorianCalendar(2022, Calendar.DECEMBER, 18).getTime());
options.ignoreMissingPackages(true);
options.noLigatures(true);
options.repeat(true);
```

Adjust interaction mode, date in the title, handling of missing packages, ligatures, and repetition as needed.

## Step 3: Initialize XPS Save Options

```java
options.setSaveOptions(new XpsSaveOptions());
```

Initialize the options for saving in XPS format.

## Step 4: Customize XPS Save Options

```java
options.getSaveOptions().rasterizeFormulas(true);
options.getSaveOptions().rasterizeIncludedGraphics(true);
options.getSaveOptions().subsetFonts(true);
```

Customize XPS save options to control the conversion of formulas, included graphics, and font subsetting.

## Step 5: Run LaTeX to XPS Conversion

```java
new TeXJob("Your Input Directory" + "sample.ltx", new XpsDevice(), options).run();
```

Initiate the conversion process by running a TeX job with the specified input file, output device (XpsDevice), and options.

## Additional Examples

Explore additional conversion methods using different input sources:

### Use InputStream

```java
new TeXJob(new ByteArrayInputStream(
    "\\documentclass{article} \\begin{document} Hello, World! \\end{document}".getBytes("ASCII")),
    new XpsDevice(), options).run();
```

### Use Main Input Terminal

```java
new TeXJob(new XpsDevice(), options).run();
```

## Conclusion

With Aspose.TeX for Java, converting LaTeX to XPS is a breeze. Follow these steps, customize the options, and seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications.
