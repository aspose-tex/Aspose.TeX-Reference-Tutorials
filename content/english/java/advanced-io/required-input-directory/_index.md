## Introduction

Are you looking to enhance your Java application's capabilities in handling TeX jobs effectively? Aspose.TeX for Java is the solution you've been searching for! In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the process of specifying a required input directory in Java using Aspose.TeX.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, let's ensure you have the necessary prerequisites set up:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment properly installed on your system.

2. Aspose.TeX for Java: Download and install the Aspose.TeX library for Java from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/java/).

3. Basic Java Knowledge: Familiarize yourself with the basics of Java programming.

Now that we have the prerequisites covered, let's move on to the next steps.

## Import Packages

To get started with Aspose.TeX for Java, you need to import the required packages. In this example, we'll be using the `RequiredInputDirectory` class. Make sure to include the following imports at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
package com.aspose.tex.RequiredInputDirectory;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import com.aspose.tex.IFileCollector;
import com.aspose.tex.IInputWorkingDirectory;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXInputStream;
```

## Step 1: Create an Instance of RequiredInputDirectory

```java
RequiredInputDirectory inputDirectory = new RequiredInputDirectory();
```

## Step 2: Store File Names

For each file entry within the required input directory, use the `storeFileName` method. This method organizes the file names by extension for easy collection.

```java
inputDirectory.storeFileName("example.tex");
```

## Step 3: Implement IInputWorkingDirectory

Implement the `IInputWorkingDirectory` interface to provide access to the required input directory.

```java
TeXInputStream inputStream = inputDirectory.getFile("example.tex", new String[1], true);
```

## Step 4: Gather File Collections by Extension

Use the `getFileNamesByExtension` method to gather file collections by extension.

```java
String[] texFiles = inputDirectory.getFileNamesByExtension(".tex");
```

## Step 5: Close the Input Directory

After processing, make sure to close the input directory using the `close` method.

```java
inputDirectory.close();
```

Follow these steps, and you'll be well on your way to effectively specify a required input directory in Java using Aspose.TeX.

## Conclusion

Aspose.TeX for Java empowers developers to handle TeX jobs seamlessly. With the step-by-step guide provided, you can easily integrate and optimize your Java application for TeX processing.
