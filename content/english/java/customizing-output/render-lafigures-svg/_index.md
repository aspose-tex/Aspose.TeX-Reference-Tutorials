## Introduction

Creating and rendering LaTeX figures in Java can be a complex yet crucial task for various applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to render LaTeX figures to SVG using Aspose.TeX for Java. Aspose.TeX provides powerful functionalities to handle LaTeX documents and convert them into various formats, including SVG.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure you have a Java development environment set up on your system.
- Aspose.TeX for Java: Download and install the Aspose.TeX library for Java from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/java/).
- Basic Understanding of LaTeX: Familiarize yourself with basic LaTeX syntax and figure creation.

## Import Packages

To begin, import the necessary packages from Aspose.TeX. These packages will provide the tools needed for rendering LaTeX figures to SVG.

```java
package com.aspose.tex.SvgLaTeXFigureRenderer;

import java.awt.Color;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;

import com.aspose.tex.SvgFigureRenderer;
import com.aspose.tex.SvgFigureRendererOptions;

import util.Utils;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Rendering Options

Create rendering options, specifying parameters such as preamble, scaling factor, background color, log stream, and terminal output visibility.

```java
SvgFigureRendererOptions options = new SvgFigureRendererOptions();
options.setPreamble("\\usepackage{pict2e}");
options.setScale(3000);
options.setBackgroundColor(Color.WHITE);
options.setLogStream(new ByteArrayOutputStream());
options.showTerminal(true);
```

## Step 2: Define LaTeX Figure and Output Directory

Define the LaTeX figure you want to render and specify the output directory for the SVG file.

```java
com.aspose.tex.Size2D size = new com.aspose.tex.Size2D.Float();
final OutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream("Your Output Directory" + "text-and-formula.svg");
```

## Step 3: Run Rendering

Run the rendering process by using the `SvgFigureRenderer` class.

```java
new SvgFigureRenderer().render("\\setlength{\\unitlength}{0.8cm}\r\n" +
    // LaTeX figure content
    "\\begin{picture}(6,5)\r\n" +
    // ... (figure details)
    "\\end{picture}", stream, options, size);
```

## Step 4: Close Output Stream

Ensure to close the output stream after rendering.

```java
if (stream != null)
    stream.close();
```

## Step 5: Display Results

Display any error reports and the dimensions of the resulting SVG image.

```java
System.out.println(options.getErrorReport());
System.out.println();
System.out.println("Size: " + size.getWidth() + "x" + size.getHeight());
```

By following these steps, you can seamlessly render LaTeX figures to SVG using Aspose.TeX for Java.

## Conclusion

Rendering LaTeX figures to SVG in Java can be achieved efficiently with Aspose.TeX. This step-by-step guide has walked you through the process, from setting up rendering options to displaying the final results. Experiment with different LaTeX figures to enhance your understanding and application of this powerful feature.
