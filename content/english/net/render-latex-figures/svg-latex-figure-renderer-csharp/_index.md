## Introduction

If you're looking to enhance your document rendering capabilities in .NET using LaTeX figures, Aspose.TeX is your go-to solution. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through rendering LaTeX figures to SVG using Aspose.TeX in C#. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear understanding of the process, empowering you to seamlessly incorporate high-quality mathematical expressions and figures into your documents.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
- Aspose.TeX for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/net/).

## Import Namespaces

In your C# code, make sure to import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.TeX.Features;
```

Now, let's break down the tutorial into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Create Rendering Options

```csharp
FigureRendererOptions options = new SvgFigureRendererOptions();
options.Preamble = "\\usepackage{pict2e}";
options.Scale = 3000;
options.BackgroundColor = Color.White;
options.LogStream = new System.IO.MemoryStream();
options.ShowTerminal = true;
```

Here, we set up rendering options, specifying the preamble, scaling factor, background color, log stream, and whether to show terminal output.

## Step 2: Define Dimensions and Output Stream

```csharp
SizeF size = new SizeF();
using (Stream stream = File.Open(Path.Combine("Your Output Directory", "text-and-formula.svg"), FileMode.Create))
{
    // Run rendering.
    new SvgFigureRenderer().Render("Your LaTeX Code", stream, options, out size);
}
```

Replace "Your Output Directory" with your desired directory and provide your LaTeX code as a string.

## Step 3: Display Results

```csharp
Console.Out.WriteLine(options.ErrorReport);
Console.Out.WriteLine();
Console.Out.WriteLine("Size: " + size);
```

This step displays any error reports and the size of the resulting image.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to render LaTeX figures to SVG using Aspose.TeX in C#. Now, you can seamlessly integrate mathematical expressions and figures into your .NET applications.
