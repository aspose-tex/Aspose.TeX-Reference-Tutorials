## Introduction

If you're delving into the world of typesetting and document creation in .NET, you're likely familiar with the challenges of rendering LaTeX figures. In this step-by-step guide, we'll explore how to use Aspose.TeX for .NET to render LaTeX figures to PNG format using C#. Aspose.TeX provides a powerful and flexible solution for handling LaTeX documents, making it an invaluable tool for developers working with document generation and formatting.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.TeX for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.TeX library for .NET installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/net/).

## Import Namespaces

In your C# code, begin by importing the necessary namespaces. This step ensures that you have access to the required classes and functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.TeX.Features;
```

## Render LaTeX Figures to PNG

### Step 1: Set Up Rendering Options

Start by creating rendering options and setting parameters such as image resolution, preamble, scaling factor, background color, and more.

```csharp
FigureRendererOptions options = new PngFigureRendererOptions() { Resolution = 150 };
options.Preamble = "\\usepackage{pict2e}";
options.Scale = 3000;
options.BackgroundColor = System.Drawing.Color.White;
options.LogStream = new System.IO.MemoryStream();
options.ShowTerminal = true;
```

### Step 2: Define Output Stream and Dimensions

Create an output stream for the PNG image and variables to store the dimensions of the resulting image.

```csharp
System.Drawing.SizeF size = new System.Drawing.SizeF();
using (System.IO.Stream stream = System.IO.File.Open(
   System.IO.Path.Combine("Your Output Directory", "text-and-formula.png"), System.IO.FileMode.Create))
{
    // Code for rendering goes here
}
```

### Step 3: Run Rendering

Implement the rendering process using the Aspose.TeX library. Provide the LaTeX code, output stream, rendering options, and size variable.

```csharp
new PngFigureRenderer().Render(@"\setlength{\unitlength}{0.8cm}
\begin{picture}(6,5)
    % LaTeX figure code goes here
\end{picture}", stream, options, out size);
```

### Step 4: Display Results

Finally, display the results, including any error reports and the size of the rendered image.

```csharp
System.Console.Out.WriteLine(options.ErrorReport);
System.Console.Out.WriteLine();
System.Console.Out.WriteLine("Size: " + size);
```

## Conclusion

With Aspose.TeX for .NET, rendering LaTeX figures to PNG format becomes a seamless process. This tutorial has walked you through the essential steps, from setting up rendering options to displaying the final results.
