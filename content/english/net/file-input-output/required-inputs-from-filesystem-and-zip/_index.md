## Introduction

Welcome to the tutorial on working with filesystem and ZIP inputs in Aspose.TeX for .NET. Aspose.TeX is a powerful .NET library that allows you to work with TeX and LaTeX documents. In this tutorial, we will focus on handling filesystem and ZIP inputs, providing you with step-by-step guidance on utilizing Aspose.TeX for efficient document conversion.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.TeX for .NET Library: Ensure you have the Aspose.TeX library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.TeX for .NET download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/net/).

- Basic Knowledge of TeX/LaTeX: Familiarity with TeX/LaTeX and their basic concepts will be beneficial.

- .NET Development Environment: Have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.

- Input Files: Prepare the necessary input files, including the TeX document and any required packages.

Now, let's get started with the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, start by importing the required namespaces to access the Aspose.TeX functionalities:

```csharp
using Aspose.TeX.IO;
using Aspose.TeX.Presentation.Image;
using System.IO;
```

## Example: Work with Filesystem & ZIP Inputs

### Step 1: Create Conversion Options

Begin by creating conversion options for the Object LaTeX format upon the Object TeX engine extension. Specify a file system working directory for the output:

```csharp
// ExStart:Conversion-RequiredInput-FileSystem
TeXOptions options = TeXOptions.ConsoleAppOptions(TeXConfig.ObjectLaTeX);
options.OutputWorkingDirectory = new OutputFileSystemDirectory("Your Output Directory");
// ExEnd:Conversion-RequiredInput-FileSystem
```

### Step 2: Specify Required Input Directory

Specify a file system working directory for the required input. The directory containing packages may be located anywhere:

```csharp
// ExStart:Specify-Required-Input-Directory
options.RequiredInputDirectory = new InputFileSystemDirectory(Path.Combine("Your Input Directory", "packages"));
// ExEnd:Specify-Required-Input-Directory
```

### Step 3: Initialize Save Options

Initialize the options for saving in PNG format:

```csharp
// ExStart:Initialize-Save-Options
options.SaveOptions = new PngSaveOptions();
// ExEnd:Initialize-Save-Options
```

### Step 4: Run LaTeX to PNG Conversion

Run the LaTeX to PNG conversion using the TeXJob class:

```csharp
// ExStart:Run-LaTeX-to-PNG-Conversion
new TeXJob(Path.Combine("Your Input Directory", "required-input-fs.tex"), new ImageDevice(), options).Run();
// ExEnd:Run-LaTeX-to-PNG-Conversion
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to work with filesystem and ZIP inputs in Aspose.TeX for .NET. This tutorial covered the essential steps from importing namespaces to running the conversion process. Aspose.TeX simplifies document manipulation, making it a valuable tool in your .NET development toolkit.
