## Introduction

Aspose.TeX for .NET is a powerful library that allows developers to work with TeX files seamlessly. To unlock its full potential, it's essential to set up a metered license. This ensures that you have the proper authorization to use the library in your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.TeX for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/net/).

2. Metered License Keys: Obtain the metered public and private keys from your Aspose account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

3. C# Development Environment: Ensure you have a working C# development environment, such as Visual Studio.

## Import Namespaces

In your C# project, start by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.TeX;
```

## Step 1: Set Metered License

The first step involves setting up the metered license within your C# code. Use the following code snippet:

```csharp
// ExStart:SetMeteredLicense
// Set metered public and private keys.
new Aspose.TeX.Metered().SetMeteredKey(
    "<type public key here>",
    "<type private key here>");
// ExEnd:SetMeteredLicense
```

Replace `<type public key here>` and `<type private key here>` with your actual metered license keys.

## Step 2: Integrate into Your Project

Once you've set the metered license, integrate Aspose.TeX into your project. You can now utilize its features without any licensing concerns.

## Step 3: Verify the License

To ensure that the metered license is applied correctly, verify it within your code:

```csharp
// ExStart:VerifyMeteredLicense
if (Aspose.TeX.Metered.IsMetered())
{
    Console.WriteLine("Metered license is set successfully!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Metered license is not set!");
}
// ExEnd:VerifyMeteredLicense
```

This step provides confirmation that the metered license is indeed in effect.

## Conclusion

Setting up a metered license for Aspose.TeX in C# is a straightforward process. By following these steps, you ensure that your development environment is properly configured for seamless integration with this powerful library.
