// Create conversion options for Object LaTeX format upon Object TeX engine extension.
TeXOptions options = TeXOptions.ConsoleAppOptions(TeXConfig.ObjectLaTeX);
// Specify a file system working directory for the output.
options.OutputWorkingDirectory = new OutputFileSystemDirectory("Your Output Directory");
// Initialize the options for saving in PDF format.
options.SaveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
// ExEnd:Conversion-LaTeXToPdf-Simplest
```

## Step 2: Run LaTeX to PDF Conversion

```csharp
// Run LaTeX to PDF conversion.
new TeXJob(Path.Combine("Your Input Directory", "hello-world.ltx"), new PdfDevice(), options).Run();
```

Repeat these steps for your specific use case, adjusting the file paths and options accordingly.
