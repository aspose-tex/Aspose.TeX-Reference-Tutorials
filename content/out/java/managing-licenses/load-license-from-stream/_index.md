## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.TeX for Java, a powerful library that simplifies TeX document manipulation and conversion tasks. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of loading a TeX license from a stream in Java. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with Aspose.TeX, this step-by-step guide will help you seamlessly integrate the license into your Java application.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.TeX for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.TeX library for Java from the [releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/java/).

- TeTeX or MiKTeX Distribution: Ensure that you have a TeX distribution such as TeTeX or MiKTeX installed on your system.

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your machine.

Now that you have the necessary tools and libraries, let's proceed to the next steps.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the required packages to access the Aspose.TeX functionalities:

```java
package com.aspose.tex.LoadLicenseFromStream;

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;

import com.aspose.tex.License;
```

## Step 1: Initialize License Object

Start by initializing the license object in your Java application. This is a crucial step before loading the license from a stream.

```java
// ExStart:LoadLicenseFromStream
// Initialize license object.
License license = new License();
```

## Step 2: Load License from Stream

Now, load the license from the stream. This example assumes that your license file is located at "D:\\Aspose.Total.Java.lic". Adjust the file path according to your setup.

```java
// Load license in FileStream.
InputStream myStream = new FileInputStream("D:\\Aspose.Total.Java.lic");

// Set license.
license.setLicense(myStream);
System.out.println("License set successfully.");
// ExEnd:LoadLicenseFromStream
```
