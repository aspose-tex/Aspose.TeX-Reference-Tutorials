## Introduction

Are you looking to enhance your document processing capabilities in Java? With Aspose.TeX, you can seamlessly convert LaTeX files to XPS format. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, ensuring you unlock the full potential of Aspose.TeX in your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.TeX for Java Library: Ensure you have the Aspose.TeX for Java library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/java/).

2. Java Development Environment: Set up a Java development environment on your machine.

3. LaTeX File: Prepare a LaTeX file (e.g., `hello-world.ltx`) that you want to convert to XPS.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to utilize Aspose.TeX functionalities. Include the following code at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
package com.aspose.tex.LaTeXXpsConversionAlternative;

import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;

import com.aspose.tex.OutputFileSystemDirectory;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXConfig;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXJob;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXOptions;
import com.aspose.tex.rendering.XpsDevice;
import com.aspose.tex.rendering.XpsSaveOptions;
```

## Step 1: Create XPS Stream

To begin the conversion, create a stream to write the XPS file. Use the following code snippet:

```java
// ExStart:Conversion-LaTeXToXps-Alternative
// Create the stream to write the XPS file to.
final OutputStream xpsStream = new FileOutputStream("Your Output Directory" + "any-name.xps");
```

## Step 2: Configure Conversion Options

Configure the conversion options to specify the LaTeX format and output directory. Add the following code:

```java
// Create conversion options for Object LaTeX format upon Object TeX engine extension.
TeXOptions options = TeXOptions.consoleAppOptions(TeXConfig.objectLaTeX());
// Specify a file system working directory for the output.
options.setOutputWorkingDirectory(new OutputFileSystemDirectory("Your Output Directory"));
// Initialize the options for saving in XPS format.
options.setSaveOptions(new XpsSaveOptions()); // Default value. Arbitrary assignment.
```

## Step 3: Run LaTeX to XPS Conversion

Execute the LaTeX to XPS conversion using the prepared options. Include the following code:

```java
// Run LaTeX to XPS conversion.
new TeXJob("Your Input Directory" + "hello-world.ltx", new XpsDevice(xpsStream), options).run();
```

## Step 4: Close the XPS Stream

Finally, ensure to close the XPS stream. Use the following code:

```java
finally {
    if (xpsStream != null)
        xpsStream.close();
}
// ExEnd:Conversion-LaTeXToXps-Alternative
```

Congratulations! You have successfully customized LaTeX to XPS conversion in Java using Aspose.TeX.
