## Introduction

If you're diving into the world of Java development and need to handle LaTeX input files from file systems efficiently, you've come to the right place. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process using Aspose.TeX, a powerful Java library designed for working with TeX and LaTeX files.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.TeX for Java: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/tex/java/).
2. License: Ensure that you have a valid license to use Aspose.TeX. You can obtain a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. Working Directory: Set up the working directories for both input and output files.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages for working with Aspose.TeX. Add the following lines at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
package com.aspose.tex.LaTeXRequiredInputFs;

import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.tex.InputFileSystemDirectory;
import com.aspose.tex.OutputFileSystemDirectory;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXConfig;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXJob;
import com.aspose.tex.TeXOptions;
import com.aspose.tex.rendering.ImageDevice;
import com.aspose.tex.rendering.PngSaveOptions;

import util.Utils;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps for a clear understanding.

## Step 1: Set License

Ensure your application is properly licensed by adding the following line:

```java
Utils.setLicense();
```

## Step 2: Configure Conversion Options

Create conversion options for Object LaTeX format using the TeX engine extension:

```java
TeXOptions options = TeXOptions.consoleAppOptions(TeXConfig.objectLaTeX());
```

## Step 3: Specify Output Working Directory

Set the output working directory for the converted files:

```java
options.setOutputWorkingDirectory(new OutputFileSystemDirectory("Your Output Directory"));
```

## Step 4: Specify Input Working Directory

Define the directory containing packages for the required input:

```java
options.setRequiredInputDirectory(new InputFileSystemDirectory("Your Input Directory" + "packages"));
```

## Step 5: Initialize Save Options

Initialize the options for saving in PNG format:

```java
options.setSaveOptions(new PngSaveOptions());
```

## Step 6: Run Conversion

Run the LaTeX to PNG conversion using the specified options:

```java
new TeXJob("Your Input Directory" + "required-input-fs.tex", new ImageDevice(), options).run();
```

Congratulations! You've successfully handled LaTeX input files from file systems in Java using Aspose.TeX.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the seamless integration of Aspose.TeX for Java to handle LaTeX input files. The library provides robust functionalities, making it an essential tool for Java developers working with TeX and LaTeX.
